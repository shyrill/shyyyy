              <p class="popup-text">Welcome to our Filipino Dishes-Heres the introduction:

                The Philippines is an exotic archipelago made up of several thousand islands, each laden with emerald rice fields, smoldering volcanoes, and ethereal tropical beaches. Filipinos are laid back, smiley, and full of charm.
                With diving, hiking and outdoor adventures galore, you’re going to work up an appetite after exploring all the natural beauty of these islands. So, what can you eat? Filipino food is hearty, sometimes sweet and sometimes sour, but definitely delicious.
                While Filipino food isn’t considered the most popular Asian dish, I can assure you it’s more than just Jollibee’s fried chicken. The Philippines was once ruled by the Spanish for some 350 years, leaving an imprint on the culture, religion, and most importantly, their gastronomy.
                So you can expect quite a variety when it comes to their flavor palette. If you’re traveling to the Philippines and wondering what food to try, these are all the best dishes to eat in the Philippines.

            <p class="popup-text">Introducing our Filipino Dishes- Try it and have fun:

                1. Adobo:
                No list of Filipino food would be complete without adobo.
                A ubiquitous dish in every household in the Philippines, its Mexican in origin.
                
                2.Lechon
                The lechon is the most invited party guest in the Philippines.
                
                The entire pig is spit-roasted over coals, with the crisp, golden-brown skin served with liver sauce, the most coveted part.
                
                In Cebu, the stomach of the pig is stuffed with star anise, pepper, spring onions, laurel leaves and lemongrass resulting in an extremely tasty lechon, which needs no sauce.
                
                In Manila, folks can get their piggy from Elars Lechon, while in Cebu, the best is CnT Lechon.

                3. Sisig:
                Nothing goes to waste in Filipino food.
                In the culinary capital of Pampanga, they turn the porks cheeks, head and liver into a sizzling dish called Sisig.
                The crunchy and chewy texture of this appetizer is a perfect match for a cold beer.
                Serve with hot sauce and Knorr seasoning to suit the preference of you and your buddies.
                Credit goes to Aling Lucing, who invented this dish at a humble stall along the train railways in Angeles City, Pampanga.

                While Sisig can be found in many restaurants, try the original version at Aling Lucing Sisig.

                4. Crispy pata:
                Not for the easily spooked, this pork knuckle is simmered, drained and deep fried until crisp.

                The meat is tender and juicy inside, with a crisp, crackling exterior.
                
                Served with vinegar, soy sauce and chili.

                5. Chicken inasal:
                Yes, it’s grilled chicken.
                But in Bacolod, this is no ordinary grilled chicken.The meat is marinated in lemongrass, calamansi, salt, pepper and garlic and brushed with achuete (annatto seeds) oil.

                Every part of the chicken is grilled here from the paa (drumstick), pecho (breast), baticulon (gizzard), atay (liver), pakpak (wings) and corazon (heart).
                It must be eaten with a generous serving of garlic rice, with some of the orange oil used to marinade the chicken poured over the rice.
                You can go chicken crazy at Manokan Country where there is a row of authentic Inasal restaurants.
